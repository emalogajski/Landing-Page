The project should have a structure like the one shown below. All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.

Usability

* All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

*Styling*

* Styling has been added for active states.

*HTML Structure*

* There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.

**Landing Page Behavior**

*Navigation*

* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

*Section Active State*

* It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

*Scroll to Anchor*

* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

**Documentation**

*README*

* The ReadMe file should have non-default text in it that is specific to this project. It doesn’t have to be thorough, but should have some basic information, and use correct markdown.

*Comments*

* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.

*Code Quality*

* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.


**Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!**

* Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
* Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
* Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
* Add a scroll to top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
* Update/change the design/content.
* Make sections collapsible.
